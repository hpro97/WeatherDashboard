# Challenge 8 Weather Dashboard - Harry Probert

A basic weather dashboard.

## Description

I built this project to implement all i've learned until now including advanced use of APIs. The weather dashboard allows you to search a city and displays the current weather alongside a next 5 day forecast, any searched cities are saved up until a number of 5, then they stat to be replaced, so instead of typing a city you are able to click a button for ease of use. I ensured full functionality after completing each requisite provided to me, debugging as necessary and adding comments for readability and clarification of how my code works. I condensed my code by assigning functions and calling them as necessary. I also added custom CSS to make the application appear more similar to to the design provided, and provide a sleaker and mnore user friendly look.
